            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> I'm a 2nd-year Software Engineering Student under the Computer Systems Engineering Dempartment at Carleton University who is infatuated with software development, robotics, computer science. As an engineering student, I believe the greatest aspects of the program are colloborating with others on projects and bringing those projects to fruition.<b></b> Besides programming, you'll often find me sketching something, playing guitar, reading, or playing basketball.<b></b> I am currently seeking a May 2023 internship and will gladly discuss open oppurtunities.</p>
